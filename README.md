*Intelligent monitoring system with face recognition and facial expression detection techniques*

### Introduction

This is an [entry](https://www.hackx.org/projects/91) in [“HACKxSJTU 2017”](https://www.hackx.org/competitions/hackxsjtu2017), a **Hackathon** contest. We use face recognitionand facial expression detection techniques to build an intelligent classroom monitoring system. This real time monitoring system will automatically detect sleepy students and record them in the database. Besides, we use speech identification method to offer several voicecontrol commands.

### Build

- Python 2.7
- Tornado 4.4.3
- MySQL
- Semantic-UI
